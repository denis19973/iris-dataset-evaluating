I applied different ML algorithms and measured accuracy for each
#### Results:
```
[SVM] CV accuracy: 0.99
[Decision Tree] CV accuracy: 0.95
[Neural Network] CV accuracy: 0.98
[Naive Bayes] CV accuracy: 0.95
```
All algorithms is doing well, but the best choice in this case is SVM with linear kernel and neural network.
